        <dt>Front-end</dt>
        <dd>
            The front-end refers to the client-side of a web application. It includes technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, which are responsible for creating the user interface and handling user interactions in the browser.
        </dd>
    
        <dt>Back-end</dt>
        <dd>
            The back-end refers to the server-side of a web application. It involves technologies like server-side programming languages (e.g., Python, Ruby, Node.js), frameworks (e.g., Django, Ruby on Rails, Express.js), and databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB). The back-end handles data storage, business logic, and server-side processing.
        </dd>
    
        <dt>Database</dt>
        <dd>
            Databases store and manage the application's data. They can be relational databases (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL) or NoSQL databases (e.g., MongoDB, Redis). Databases are used to store, retrieve, and manipulate data for the web application.
        </dd>
    
        <dt>API</dt>
        <dd>
            An API (Application Programming Interface) allows different software systems to communicate and interact with each other. APIs define a set of rules and protocols that enable developers to access and use functionalities and data from external services or applications.
        </dd>
    
        <dt>Version Control</dt>
        <dd>
            Version control systems (e.g., Git) track changes to source code files over time, enabling collaboration among developers. They provide a history of changes, allow for branching and merging of code, and facilitate team collaboration in software development projects.
        </dd>
    
        <dt>Deployment</dt>
        <dd>
            Deployment involves the process of making a web application accessible and functional on a production server. It includes tasks such as configuring the server, managing dependencies, setting up security measures, and ensuring the application runs smoothly in a live environment.
